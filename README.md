# Aunty Bot

NOTICE: This repo has been moved to the [ABC News Github](https://github.com/abcnews/story-lab-standup-bot).

A bot that sends messages to our Slack channel.

Currently it provides a preference order of who should run standup when it's time to do a standup.

It's currently running on my Raspberry Pi as a cron job.
